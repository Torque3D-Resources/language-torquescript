# TorqueScript language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to TorqueScript files in Atom.

Originally [converted](http://atom.io/docs/latest-converting-a-text-mate-bundle) from the [TorqueScript TextMate bundle](http://mysterycoconut.com/tsmate/) and improved upon.

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
